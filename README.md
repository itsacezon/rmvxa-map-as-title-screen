Map as Title Screen
=========================
#### An RPG Maker VX Ace Script

Customize your title screen by using your map as its background! Add more eye candy by using [Yamiâ€™s Title Decorate Script] [yami] for the menu. Just plug this in your scripts and configure in the Map_Properties module.
